# My list of phrases.
It is a personal project to improve my programming skills. The idea of the application came from a personal need. I needed a place to store English phrases to study them in the future. That is practically what I plan to develop in this application, to be able to create phrases in Spanish and be able to see their translation and then study them. I dared to make an API rest where I can store those phrases and their translation so that it can be consumed by a front end and all with good programming practices. 

This is a learning project. I am developing it only with documentation and useful resources that I find on the internet in order to improve my skills.

If you use a portion of the code let me know, I would be very happy to know that you found it useful.
